### Description:

By way of dynamic polymorphism this program creates a fighter character by way of reading in a list of characters from an input file and placing thoses characters into a vector then to a character pointer that points to a base class and assigns random attributes withing certain parameters to said character such as "1.d.4" or "1.d.6" damage for a warrior class, and that makes the attackers. the defenders are generated at a ratio of 1 for every 100 attackers, but have the ability to regen HP. The two sides battle and the winner is decided by which side still has characters within their vector "One could say to the last man standing". 


One of the main purposes of this program is to further expand the understanding of dynamic polymorphism
