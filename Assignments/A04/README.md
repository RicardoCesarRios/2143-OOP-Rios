# OOP TERMINOLOGY
## Abstraction
Abstraction in C++ Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.

## Attributes / Properties

Attributes/Properties are data members inside a class or an object that represent the different features of the class. They can also be referred to as characteristics of the class that can be accessed from other objects or differentiate a class from other classes.

## Class
A class in C++ is a user-defined type or data structure declared with keyword class that has data and functions as its members whose access is governed by the three access specifiers private, protected or public. By default access to members of a C++ class is private.

## Class Variable
Class Variables and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".

## Composition
In C++ Composition, an object is a part of another object. The object that is a part of another object is known as sub object. When a C++ Composition is destroyed, then all of its sub objects are destroyed as well. Such as when car is destroyed, then its motor, frame, and other part are also destroyed with it. It has do and die relationship.

## Constructor
Constructor in C++ is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally. The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure. Constructor is invoked at the time of object creation. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is known as constructors.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.

## Friends
### Friend Class
Friend Class A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class. For example, a LinkedList class may be allowed to access private members of Node. 

A friend class can access both private and protected members of the class in which it has been declared as friend.

### Friend Function

Friend Function Like friend class, a friend function can be given a special grant to access private and protected members. A friend function can be: 
a) A member of another class 
b) A global function
